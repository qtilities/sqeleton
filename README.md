# sqeleton (WIP)

Qt application template repository.

The goal of this project is to be used to create new applications by starting
from a template that provides already the minimal code and resources creation like:

- Application icon code
- Locale translations via [LXQt build tools]
- [Appstream] metadata information


[LXQt build tools]: https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-build-tools
[Appstream]:        https://freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Quickstart.html
